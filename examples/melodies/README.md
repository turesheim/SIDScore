Rules for event melodies:

- Keep 3‑bar phrases, average note tokens ~56.
- Preserve “style by number” across get_ready, extra_life, life_lost, game_over, high_score.
- Keep moods via tempo and octave shifts:
  - Get Ready: optimistic (baseline tempo).
  - Extra Life: jolly (faster + higher lead/pad).
  - High Score: triumphant (slightly faster + higher lead).
  - Life Lost: less sad (minor, slightly slower).
  - Game Over: really sad (minor, much slower + lower octaves).
